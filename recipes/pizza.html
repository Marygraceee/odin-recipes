    </ul>
    </p>Today we will learn how to make the italian variety of pizza, the Neapolitan Pizza.
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g Flour</li>
        <li>120g Water</li>
        <li>50g Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>100g Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>10g of dried yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make Neapolitan Pizza:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, the water and the yeast, then knead.  </li>
        <li>When the dough is almost silky, add the salt, then cover the dough under a damp cloth</li>
        <li>Wait 30 minutes, then knead the dough again. After that, let the dough rest and rise for 3-4 hours</li>
        <li>When the dough is ready, place it on the table and start pressing on it, making sure not to press on the cruts, otherwise the air will escape</li>
        <li>When your dough "pie" is round and thin, spread some tomato sauce, making sure not to put it on the crust</li>
        <li>Add mozzarella, making sure not to overdo it: 100g are enough (I'm talking to you, Americans!)</li>
        <li>Put the pizza in the over at max temperature for 15 minutes. For the first 10 minutes the pizza has to cook on the lowest possible position in the oven <br>
        In the remaining 5 minutes, the pizza has to cook on the highest spot in the oven </li>
        <li>When the pizza is cooked, place it on a plate and add extra virgin olive oil to taste</li>
            </ol>
